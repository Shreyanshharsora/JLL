                                        <p>JLL may, without prior notice and for any or no reason in its discretion, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; create usage limits for the Service; or block or deny you access to the Service at any time without notice.</p>
                                        <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. JLL will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this instruction</p>

										<p>The text, information, graphics and other data (the “Content”)  presented in the Service was and is compiled, selected, and arranged by JLL through the application of methods and judgment developed and applied with the expenditure of substantial time, effort and money, and constitutes valuable intellectual property and trade secrets of JLL or its licensors.

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
										<p>Your access to and use of the Service or any Content is at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Service is provided to you on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Without limiting the foregoing, JLL AND ITS PARTNERS DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.  All information contained in the Service is from sources deemed reliable; however, JLL makes no warranty and disclaim all responsibility and liability for the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Service or any Content thereon.  JLL will not be responsible or liable for any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Service, or any Content.  We make no warranty that the Service will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis.  No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from JLL or through the Service, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.</p>
                                        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, JLL AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE; AND (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT JLL HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>			
                                        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.</p>
										<p>If anyone brings a claim against us related to your actions or content on the Service, or actions or content by or from someone using your account, you will indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable legal fees and costs) related to such claim.</p>
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p><strong>General Terms</strong></p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
										<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. Unless submitted to arbitration as set forth in the following paragraph, all claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Service will be brought solely in Cook County, Illinois, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
										<p>For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under these Terms where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party electing such arbitration shall initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, as selected by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
										<p>These Terms are the entire and exclusive agreement between JLL and you regarding the Service (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with JLL that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between JLL and you regarding the Service.</p>	
                                        <p>The failure of JLL to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
										<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. The most current version will always be on this page (or such other page as the Service may indicate). If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via posting to our website or e-mail to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
